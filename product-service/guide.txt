controller advice work on controller layer and command dispatch interceptor & command handler
but if exception occurred in event handler in same application aborted this and continue other event handler
also dont propagate exception occurred in event handler for this need to add bean of ListenerInvocationErrorHandler
and if exception occurred in one of event handler block that as soon as possible and
rollback transaction (event sourcing with other event handler) if using subscribing event processing that manages
in same thread it is useful whenever we want to handle transaction in same application using subscribing event processing
but if want to handle exception and transaction in across different microservice we need to use saga pattern
